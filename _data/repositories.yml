  description: Modern browsers include the classList API that has a great performance but in some projects you can't take advantage of that boost because you need to cover old browsers (I'm looking at you IE).

  description: Create a progress bar that indicates how much you've scrolled on a website. It's very useful to show the reading progress in an article or a blog post. Just add the script and call scrollProgress.init() and a black bar on the upper part of your website to show the scrolling progress. The script supports IE9+ and all modern browsers.
