title: How to shuffle an array
resume: The other day I was asked at work to sort randomly an array of objects and while it didn't seem a very complex task it turned out into hours of investigation. So yes, it is a complex scenario and there are a lot of possible solutions.
---

Whatever it was the solution it needed two things to beat any other one. The first thing was the frequency distribution of the possible results which basically means that I wanted any combination of the items to be equally probable to appear. The second one was performance.

Without overthinking these concerns I decided to quickly bring an algorithm that would do the job, just as a start and later dive into alternatives and testing.


### From the scratch

Trying to cover my first concern, equally probable results, I came up with this idea. First of all make a copy of the array. Get a random position, something like *0 < position < array.length - 1*, take the item in that position out of the array and put it inside a new one. Then repeat that again considering that now the array length has decreased by one until the copied array is empty.

The best thing of this approach is that every iteration is independent from the previous one. And if you think this is not a big deal I'll show you some code samples that are popular in forums that don't even cover this when they are asked for a solution to this problem, but let's stick with this for now.

#### Copy an array

We need to do this so we don't actually modify the original one. There's an array method called *slice* that takes two parameters, a position a number of elements you want to take from that position and return a new array containing only those elements, if you need a better understanding of it check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice" target="blank">MDN reference</a>.

What's funny is that if you don't pass any arguments to slice it basically returns a new array with the exact same elements, and that's what we're going to do.

```js
function shuffle(array) {
    
    var origArray = array.slice();
}
```

#### Get a random position

There's a pretty famous guy in the neighbourhood called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random" target="_blank">Math.random()</a> which basically returns a number between *0* and *0.99*. Let's say we have an array with three elements, if we call this method and then multiply it for the length of the array we can get a value between *0 * 3 = 0* and *0.99 * 3 = 2.99*. Removing the floating part of any of the possible results of this calculation we can get zero, one or two that are the three possible positions in an array of three elements. What really surrised me is that JavaScript doesn't have a method to do that or to be more accurate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/trunc" target="_blank">it has one but it's not present in all browsers</a>. A good alternative is to use *parseInt()* for now.

```js
function shuffle(array) {
    
    var origArray = array.slice(), 
        len = origArray.length,
        position;

    position = parseInt(Math.random() * len);
}
```

Now we must put this logic inside a loop and decrease the length for every iteration.

```js
function shuffle(array) {
    
    var origArray = array.slice(), 
        len = origArray.length,
        position;

    while (len) {
        position = parseInt(Math.random() * len--);
    }
}
```

Simple and beautiful... and useless, because it's still doing nothing.


#### Return a new shuffled array

We still need to extract the element in that position from *origArray* and store it in a new one. For that we can use *splice* which does the same thing as *slice* but it removes the result from the original. array.

```js
function shuffle(array) {
    
    var origArray = array.slice(),
        len = origArray.length,
        newArray = [], 
        position;

    while (len) {
        position = parseInt(Math.random() * len--);
        newArray.push(origArray.splice(position, 1));
    }

    return newArray;
}
```

If you want to shorten this code you can put all the logic in a single line. Also I don't want to go through all these steps if I receive an array with a single element or an undefined object so we can add an exception for that.

```js
function shuffle(array) {
    
    if (!!array && array.length > 1) {
        var origArray = array.slice(),
            len = origArray.length;
            newArray = []; 

        while (len) {
            newArray.push(origArray.splice(parseInt(Math.random() * len--), 1)[0]);
        }
    } else {
        return array ? array.slice() : [];
    }

    return newArray;
}
```

I've created a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jeremenichelli/7qLbpr1b/6/" target="_blank">fiddle</a> where you can see this working. It also contains an iteration that gets executed a thousand times with the results being shown in the console.

After running a few tests and making sure it worked well I started searching for alternatives and stepped out with what I think is an ugly solution to this.


### Using sort, just don't do it

Don't get me wrong, I think <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" target="_blank">sort</a> is great, but the original purpose of is to establish a new known order for an array, you need a compare function and a criteria. Random isn't a known order and has no criteria, but well, here's the little monster I found out there...

```js
array.sort(function() { return 0.5 - Math.random() });
```

Beautiful, isn't it? Just one line, something that will want you to put it inside your code right away because, you know, it's just one line man! The problem with this is that is not taking in consideration how *sort* works. Every time the compare function is called, sort expects a negative number, a positive number or zero. In case the number is negative the second element in comparison will be moved before the first one, the opposite will happen if the number is positive and nothing will happen if the number returned is zero. That's pretty useful but since we want to create a random scenario half of the times the compare function is called there's a high chance that nothing will happen, leaving the elements in the position they are. We don't want that. If you send an array of two or three elements there's a high probability you will get the exact same array and after running these tests <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jeremenichelli/vhn6nbfy/1/" target="_blank">that's what actually happens</a>.


### The best solution out there

I supposed that this problem wasn't new and that probably smarter people than me already had a solution for a well distributed and performant algorithm. Both things were true. The solution is very old and it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherâ€“Yates_shuffle" target="_blank">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a> named after Ronald Fisher and Frank Yates. It basically asures you that any possible permutation is equally likely and it's the one applied by underscore library. You can check that implementation on <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L342" target="_blank">github</a> that has only some little adjustments to match underscore needs.

If you need this code without underscore dependencies here's a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/jeremenichelli/4ze2buLa/2/" target="_blank">fiddle</a> with the method and some tests showing how well distributed are the frequencies. You can also check its performance <a href="http://jsperf.com/most-performant-shuffle-method-for-arrays" target="_blank">here</a>.


### Wrap-up

I knew that there was probably a better solution for this before starting my own approach, but I think that giving it a try gives you a great opportunity to think, investigate and learn a lot not only about the problem itself, you also get to know new methods, new tools, new patterns. 

That's the good thing about trying to make your own way through challenges. I hope this post reflected some of that experience and in case you were looking for a nice solution to shuffle an array that it was also useful.

Happy shuffling!
