title: I'm taking my time
resume: Sadly, I didn't have the time (and the energy) that I would like to write here more often. The good news is that somehow, even on the hard times, it ends up in a new idea, and as a consequence, in a new script.

<p>These last weeks weren't the best, both personal and work life. Details aren't important.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to have a blog but everytime a lot of questions came to my mind like <strong>will you have the time to write posts?</strong> or <strong>do you really have something to write about?</strong> and my all time favorite <strong>are you sure?</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is that you're reading this and that means that a few months ago I asked myself the same questions and suddenly the answer were <strong>yes</strong>, <strong>yes</strong> and my all time favorite <strong>yes</strong></p>

<h3>You have to try</h3>
<p>I had some ideas about what the next post could be, I still have them noted down just in case. Sadly there were always a problem or an event I had to (and wanted to) go that was getting in my way. Honestly, some days I wanted but I wasn't in the right mood to do it.</p>
<p>But I tried. I tried with one idea, but couldn't wrap it. For other post I had to do a lot of scripts and testing and didn't have the time. One saturday morning I was going to write down about some approach I used a long time ago, an interesting one actually, but I needed time to make some investigation because performance matters now. I mean, performance always mattered but I wasn't the developer I am today in that time. Not that I'm great now, but, well I'm sure you got my point.</p>
<p>I needed to investigate this and that's actually fun, but <strong>I didn't have the time to do it in that morning</strong>. I started, and since the thing I wanted to test involved loops and I wanted to measure time, <strong>just like in my life</strong>. Well I wanted to test execution time in this case.</p>

<h3>The script</h3>
<p>So, I said to myself, take it cool. <strong>Enjoy it!</strong> And I did it actually. I had to write something like a chronometer, something that started counting and at any given moment log how much time has passed. And I did it actually.</p>
<p>The result of all of this is <a href="https://github.com/jeremenichelli/chronos" target="_blank">Chronos</a>, a script that allows you to measure how many time has passed since you initialized it. You can create all the Chronos instances you wanted using the word <em>new</em> and you can put checkpoints wherever you want and as much as you need. You can label them to have an idea of what is in consideration regarding that particular checkpoint.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I'm going to add a lot of new things so stay tuned. Of course I'm open to suggestions so if you have some just throw them on the repository.</p>

<h3>Wrap up</h3>
<p>I enjoy having a blog a lot, even if I can't write as much as I would like to. If you're reading this, <strong>thanks</strong> because is great to have you around and means a lot. Really. And if you think you need more time to do things you like just try, just start doing them. Measure your time. And if you need to measure the time in your scripts you have <a href="https://github.com/jeremenichelli/chronos" target="_blank">Chronos</a>.</p>
<p>Hope to see you around soon and happy coding!</p>
