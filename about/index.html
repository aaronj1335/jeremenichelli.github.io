            <h2>Build process</h2>
            <p>Every time a change in styles or scripts happens <a href="https://www.gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp</a> is the one in charge of the heavy tasks. Two different set of LESS files are processed, one containing non-critical rules and other one that is transformed into an HTML include file that is placed in the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> tag, both being previously <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer">autoprefixed</a> and minified. Something similar happens to scripts.</p>

            <h2>Styles and Design</h2>
            <p>This project uses <a href="https://www.lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a> as the preprocessor for styles. The grid system was built using <a href="https://jeremenichelli.github.io/gridbuilder">this little helper</a> and the colors come from the <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.htm" target="_blank">Material Design</a> style guide by Google. The menu on mobile is heavily inspired on the one you can find in <a href="https://www.adtile.me" target="_blank">Adtile</a> website.</p>
            <p>In blog posts you might notice a reading progress bar on the bottom that hides when you scroll up and re-appears when scrolling down. To achieve this I've used two of my repositories, <a href="https://github.com/jeremenichelli/scrollProgress">scrollProgress</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jeremenichelli/steer">steer</a>.</p>
            <p>Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bogardus" target="_blank">Lisandro Vico</a> who provided a great feedback on this new design. Small details, big changes!</p>

            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>The font that rules the whole site is Roboto Condensed by Christian Robertson, interface designer at Google and the one from the logo is Southpaw crafted by <a href="https://www.tylerfinck.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Finck</a>, whose work you should definitely check out by the way, along with Allison Usavage. The social SVG icons are a creation by Sam Collins.</p>

            <h2>Scripts</h2>
            <p>The only dependency until date that this site contains is a reading progress bar implemented in posts, in case you didn't notice it. It is an open source library so feel free to <a href="https://github.com/jeremenichelli/scrollProgress" target="_blank">grab it</a>.</p>

            <h2>Site generator and hosting</h2>
            <p>As I mentioned above <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is the site generator that runs this whole site that is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. If you're more intereseted in creating a site using Jekyll, I wrote some posts showing how to set up, create layouts and generate posts with it.</p>
