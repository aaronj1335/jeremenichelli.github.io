            <h3 class="about--main-title">Story and experience</h3>
            <p>In the past, I spent some time working on small sites for companies that were settled on my home town while studying, but decided to make some changes, quit my job and leave university because I wasn't really learning and enjoying it as I did before.</p>
            <p>The next step was to become a self-taught front end developer.</p>
            <p>That same year, I was hired by <a href="https://www.globant.com" target="_blank">Globant</a> and had the chance to work with big brands and companies like Microsoft, StateFarm and the New York Stock Exchange between others on beautiful and scalable responsive web projects.</p>
            <p>Later, I joined <a href="https://www.ordergroove.com" target="_blank">OrderGroove</a> to build awesome scripts that power the subscription revolution with their great team from New York.</p>

            <h2 class="about--main-title">About this site</h2>
            <p>This site was built using <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. If you're more intereseted in creating a site using Jekyll, I wrote some posts showing how to set up, create layouts and generate posts with it.</p>
            <h3>Styles and Design</h3>
            <p>This project uses <a href="https://www.lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a> as a preprocessor for styles. The grid system was built using <a href="https://jeremenichelli.github.io/gridbuilder">this little helper</a> and the colors come from the <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.htm" target="_blank">Material Design</a> style guide by Google.</p>
            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <p>The font that rules the whole site is Roboto Condensed by Christian Robertson, interface designer at Google and the one from the logo is Southpaw crafted by <a href="https://www.tylerfinck.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Finck</a>, whose work you should definitely check out by the way.</p>
            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <p>All the posts in my blog are written using Markdown.</p>
            <h3>Browser support</h3>
            <p>This site <em>should</em> run perfectly in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Safari mobile, Chrome for Android, Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and Microsoft Edge.</p>
            <p>If you see something that is not working good or that could be improved feel free to <a href="https://github.com/jeremenichelli/jeremenichelli.github.io/issues" target="_blank">report it</a>.</p>
