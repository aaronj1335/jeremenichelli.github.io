## Story and experience

After spending some time working on small sites for companies settled on my home town while studying, I decided to make some changes, quit my job and leave university since I wasnâ€™t really learning and enjoying it as I did before.

The next step was to become a self-taught front end developer.

That same year, <a href="https://www.globant.com" target="_blank">Globant</a> hired me and I had the chance to work with clients like Microsoft, StateFarm and NYSE on great responsive projects.

Later, I joined <a href="https://www.ordergroove.com" target="_blank">OrderGroove</a> to build awesome scripts that power the subscription revolution with their great team from New York.

I also say stuff on [Twitter][tw] and throw some code on [GitHub][gh].

## About this site

Built with [Jekyll][1] and is hosted by [GitHub Pages][2] to work. Though it was developed from scratch, the design was heavily inspired by Heiswayi Nrird's [the plain theme][3].
