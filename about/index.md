## Experience

I was lucky enough to be part of great teams in **Globant**, **Razorfish**, **Velocity&nbsp;Partners** and&nbsp;**Jam3**.

I've built responsive sites for companies like **Microsoft**, **StateFarm** and the **NYSE** and have participated in projects with a heavy focus on design and animations for **ESPN**, **Google**, **Disney**, **Instagram** and **Facebook**.

I've also worked on big code bases and web applications.

On my free time I like to contribute to open source projects and write articles.
