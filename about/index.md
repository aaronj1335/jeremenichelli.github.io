## Experience

I was lucky enough to be part of great teams in **Globant**, **Razorfish**, **Velocity&nbsp;Partners** and&nbsp;**Jam3**.

I've worked in projects with a heavy focused on design and animations for **ESPN**, **Google**, **Disney**, **Microsoft**, **StateFarm**, **Instagram** and&nbsp;**Facebook** and also built and maintained big code bases for companies like **OrderGroove**.

On my free time I like to contribute to open source projects and write articles.
