My name is Jeremias Menichelli and I love the web, that's why I work as a front end developer to make it better, using JavaScript and CSS to build beautiful products, with a big eye on usability and performance.

## Story and experience

After spending some time working on small sites for companies that were settled on my home town while studying, but decided to make some changes, quit my job and leave university because I wasn't really learning and enjoying it as I did before.

The next step was to become a self-taught front end developer.

That same year, I was hired by <a href="https://www.globant.com" target="_blank">Globant</a> and had the chance to work with clients like Microsoft, StateFarm and the New York Stock Exchange on beautiful and scalable responsive web projects.

Later, I joined <a href="https://www.ordergroove.com" target="_blank">OrderGroove</a> to build awesome scripts that power the subscription revolution with their great team from New York.

I also say stuff on [Twitter][tw] and throw some code on [GitHub][gh].

## About this site

Built with [Jekyll][1] and is hosted by [GitHub Pages][2] to work. Though it was developed from scratch, the design was heavily inspired by [the plain theme][3] whose author is [Heiswayi Nrird][4].
