# jeremenichelli.github.io

This is the repository that runs my personal site and blog.


## About this site

This site was built using <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. If you're more intereseted in creating a site using Jekyll, I wrote some posts showing how to set up, create layouts and generate posts with it.


### Styles and Design

This project uses <a href="https://www.lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a> as a preprocessor for styles. The grid system was built using <a href="https://jeremenichelli.github.io/gridbuilder">this little helper</a> and the colors come from the <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.htm" target="_blank">Material Design</a> style guide by Google.


### Fonts

The font that rules the whole site is Roboto Condensed by Christian Robertson, interface designer at Google and the one from the logo is Southpaw crafted by <a href="https://www.tylerfinck.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Finck</a>, whose work you should definitely check out by the way.</p>


Writing

All the posts in my blog are written using Markdown.


### Browser support

This site _**should**_ run perfectly in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Safari mobile, Chrome for Android, Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and Microsoft Edge.
